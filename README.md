# Mill Creek Agency AutoMailer

I Currently work at an insurance agency and part of my job is sending out renewals for [Ocean Harbor Casualty](https://www.oceanharbor-ins.com/) and [Narragansett Bay](http://www.nbic.com/). This consists of three parts, updating the policy on our online system (QQ Catalyst), sending out a renewal email or letter to let the insured know that their policy has been renewed, and sending the invoice to the insured's mortgagee letting the mortgagee know what needs to be paid.

This application was created to automate this process

Currently the script can extract the insured's:

 - Name
 - Address
 - Policy Number
 - Coverages:
    - Building
    - Other Structure 
    - Personal Property
    - Loss of Use 
    - Personal Liability
    - Medical Payments
 - Premium
 - Deductible
 - Hurricane Deductible
 - Mortgagee
 - Effective / Expire date

It can support Ocean Harbor HO3 and Dwelling and HO3 Narragansett Bay.
